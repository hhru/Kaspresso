# Kaspresso configurator

**Kaspresso** class - is a single point to set Kaspresso parameters. <br>
A developer can customize **Kaspresso** by setting ```Kaspresso.Builder``` at constructors of ```TestCase```, ```BaseTestCase```, ```TestCaseRule```, ```BaseTestCaseRule```.

### Structure

All settings in **Kaspresso** class may be divided into four groups: <br>

#### Loggers
```libLogger``` - inner Kaspresso logger <br>
```testLogger``` - logger available for developers in tests. <br>
It's available by ```testLogger``` property in test sections (```before, after, init, transform, run```) in test dsl (by ```TestContext``` class). <br>
Also it is availaible while setting ```Kaspresso.Builder``` if you want to add it to your custom interceptors, for example.<br>

#### Kaspresso interceptors based on Kakao Interceptors.
These interceptors were introduced to simplify and uniform using of [Kakao interceptors](https://github.com/agoda-com/Kakao#intercepting).<br> <br>
_**Important moment**_ about a mixing of Kaspresso interceptors and Kakao interceptors. <br>
Kaspresso interceptors will not work if You set your custom Kakao interceptors by calling of ```Kakao.intercept``` method in the test. <br> 
If you set your custom Kakao interceptors for concrete ```Screen``` or ```KView``` and set argument ```isOverride``` in true then Kaspresso interceptors will not work for concrete ```Screen``` or ```KView``` fully. 
<br> <br>
Kaspresso interceptors can be divided into two types: <br>
1. ```Behavior Interceptors``` - are intercepting calls to ViewInteraction, DataInteraction, WebInteraction and do some stuff. **Attention**, we will consider some important notes about ```Behavior Interceptors``` at the end of this document. <br>
2. ```Watcher Interceptors``` - are intercepting calls to ViewAction, ViewAssertion, Atom, WebAssertion and do some stuff. <br>

Let's expand mentioned Kaspresso interceptors types: <br>
1. ```Behavior Interceptors```
    1. ```viewBehaviorInterceptor``` - intercept calls to ```ViewInteraction#perform``` and ```ViewInteraction#check``` <br>
    2. ```dataBehaviorInterceptor``` - intercept calls to ```DataInteraction#check``` <br>
    3. ```webBehaviorInterceptor``` - intercept calls to ```Web.WebInteraction<R>#perform``` and ```Web.WebInteraction<R>#check``` <br>
2. ```Watcher Interceptors```
    1. ```viewActionWatcherInterceptors``` - do some stuff before [android.support.test.espresso.ViewAction.perform] is actually called <br>
    2. ```viewAssertionWatcherInterceptors``` - do some stuff before [android.support.test.espresso.ViewAssertion.check] is actually called <br>
    3. ```atomWatcherInterceptors``` - do some stuff before [android.support.test.espresso.web.model.Atom.transform] is actually called <br>
    4. ```webAssertionWatcherInterceptors``` - do some stuff before [android.support.test.espresso.web.assertion.WebAssertion.checkResult] is actually called <br>

#### Special Kaspresso interceptors
These interceptors are not based on some lib. Short description:
1. ```stepWatcherInterceptors``` - an interceptor of **Step** lifecycle actions
2. ```testRunWatcherInterceptors``` - an interceptor of entire **Test** lifecycle actions

As you noticed it's also a part of ```Watcher Interceptors```.

#### BuildStepReportWatcherInterceptor

This ```watcher interceptor``` by default included into ```Kaspresso configurator``` to collect your tests steps information for further processing in tests orchestrator.
By default this interceptor based on ```AllureReportWriter``` (if you don't know what [Allure](http://allure.qatools.ru/) is you should really check on it).
This report writer works with each ```TestInfo``` after test finishing, converts it's steps information into [Allure's steps info](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_steps) JSON,
and then prints JSON into LogCat in the following format:

```
I/KASPRESSO: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I/KASPRESSO: TEST PASSED
I/KASPRESSO: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I/KASPRESSO: #AllureStepsInfoJson#: [{"attachments":[],"name":"My step 1","parameters":[],"stage":"finished","start":1568790287246,"status":"passed", "steps":[],"stop":1568790288184}]
```

This logs should be processed by your test orchestrator (e.g. [Marathon](https://github.com/Malinskiy/marathon)).
If you use [Marathon](https://github.com/Malinskiy/marathon) you should know that the [latest version](https://github.com/Malinskiy/marathon/releases/tag/0.5.0)
requires some additional modifications to support processing this logs and for now doesn't work as expected. But we are working hard on it.
    
#### Device
```Device``` instance. Detailed info is at [Device wiki](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/Kaspresso/blob/master/wiki/03.%20Device.md)

#### AdbServer
```AdbServer``` instance. Detailed info is at [AdbServer wiki](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/Kaspresso/blob/master/wiki/04.%20AdbServer.md)

### Using

All actions to add Kaspresso in the test where Espresso and Kakao are using is one of:
- extend ```BaseTestCase``` or ```TestCase```
- add ```BaseTestCaseRule``` or ```TestCaseRule``` rule field in your test  

### Kaspresso configuring and Kaspresso interceptors example

The example of how to configure Kaspresso and how to use Kaspresso interceptors are in [configurator](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/Kaspresso/tree/master/sample/src/androidTest/java/com/kaspersky/kaspressample/configurator_tests).

### Default Kaspresso settings
```BaseTestCase```, ```TestCase```, ```BaseTestCaseRule```, ```TestCaseRule``` are using default customized **Kaspresso**. <br>
Most valuable features of default customized **Kaspresso** are below.

#### Logging
Just start [SimpleTest](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/Kaspresso/blob/master/sample/src/androidTest/java/com/kaspersky/kaspressample/simple_tests/SimpleTest.kt). Next, you will see those logs:

Pretty good.

#### Screenshots
A developer receives a screenshot after each Step and after any error. Screenshots are saving at Device in "sdcard/screenshots/". 

### Some words about Behavior Interceptors
Any lib for ui-tests is flaky. It's a hard truth of life. Any action/assert in your test may fail for some undefined reason. <br>
What kinds of flaky errors are exist:
1. Common flaky errors that happened because Espresso was in a bad mood =) <br>
That's why Kaspresso wraps **all** actions/assertions of Kakao and handles set of potential flaky exceptions.
If an exception happened then Kaspresso attempts to repeat failed actions/assert for 5 seconds. Such handling rescues developers of any flaky action/assert.<br>
The details are at [flakysafety](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/Kaspresso/tree/master/kaspresso/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/kaspresso/flakysafety). <br>
2. If the fault is due to an interaction with an element which is not visible and to which you need to scroll, Kaspresso will try to fix it by performing an autoscroll action by itself. <br>
The details are at [autoscroll](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/Kaspresso/tree/master/kaspresso/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/kaspresso/autoscroll). <br>
3. Also, Kaspresso attempts to remove all system dialogs if it prevents the test executes. <br>
The details are at [systemsafety](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/Kaspresso/tree/master/kaspresso/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/kaspresso/systemsafety). <br>

These handlings are possible thanks to ```BehaviorInterceptors```. Also, you can set your custom handlings by ```Kaspresso.Builder```. But remember the order of ```BehaviorInterceptors``` is significant: the first item will be at the lowest level of intercepting chain, and the last item will be at the highest level. For example, the first item actually wraps the ```androidx.test.espresso.ViewInteraction.perform``` call, the second item wraps the first item, and so on. <br>
Let's consider the order of ```BehaviorInterceptors``` enabled by default in Kaspresso. It's: <br> 
1. ```AutoScrollViewBehaviorInterceptor```
2. ```SystemDialogSafetyViewBehaviorInterceptor```
3. ```FlakySafeViewBehaviorInterceptor```
4. ```FailureLoggingViewBehaviorInterceptor```

When Kakao intercepting is than the chain is <br>
```FailureLoggingViewBehaviorInterceptor``` calls ```FlakySafeViewBehaviorInterceptor``` that calls ```SystemDialogSafetyViewBehaviorInterceptor``` and that calls ```AutoScrollViewBehaviorInterceptor```. <br> 
If a result of ```AutoScrollViewBehaviorInterceptor``` handling is an error then ```SystemDialogSafetyViewBehaviorInterceptor``` attempts to handle received error. If a result of ```SystemDialogSafetyViewBehaviorInterceptor``` handling is an error also then ```FlakySafeViewBehaviorInterceptor``` attempts to handle received the error. And so on. <br>
To simplify all described above we have drawn a picture:
